### How to run the app
**Ensure that .Net has been properly installed on the machine before running**

*We've provided a set of our best generation files to make the process faster. Those will be overwritten once the console application has been ran.*

- use the following command to move to the correct folder (RobbyIterationGenerator) ```cd RobbyIterationGenerator```
- Inside the folder use the following command ```dotnet run```
  - This will run the console application.
  - The console will ask you to enter data needed to run the simulation
  - The saved generations will be saved in a folder called generations, which is inside the RobbyVisualizer folder
- Once the generations have been created using the console app, use the following command to move to the correct folder to run the Visualizer ```cd ../RobbyVisualizer```
- Once inside the folder, use this command to run the Visualizer ```dotnet run```
  - The first generation may not move or do much, do not worry. Robby is slightly stupid at this stage and should be forgiven for being boring.
